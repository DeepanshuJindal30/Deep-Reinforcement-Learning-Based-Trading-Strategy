Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Trading Strategy
This repository contains an implementation of a trading strategy using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The strategy utilizes a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) model to make trading decisions such as buying, selling, or holding stocks based on historical market data. The goal is to maximize profits by making intelligent trading decisions at each time step.

Problem Definition
The goal is to create a trading agent that can make decisions based on historical stock price data. The agent uses Deep Q-Learning to predict the optimal action (buy, sell, or hold) for each time step in order to maximize cumulative profit.

Key components:

Agent: The trading agent which interacts with the market.
Action: Three possible actions: Buy, Sell, or Hold.
Reward Function: The realized profit or loss after a buy or sell action. Holding results in no reward.
State: Differences in stock prices over a window of time.
The dataset used for training and testing is the S&P 500 historical data, which is available on Yahoo Finance.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:

Python 3.x
Keras (for implementing Deep Q-Learning)
Pandas (for data handling)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
Seaborn (for data visualization)
Scikit-learn (for data preprocessing)
You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install keras pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the historical stock prices of the S&P 500, available at Yahoo Finance. Download and place the CSV file (SP500.csv) in the data/ directory.

Training the Model
Load the dataset: The dataset is read and cleaned, with any missing values filled using forward fill.

Data Preprocessing: The data is split into training and testing sets.

Training: The agent is trained using Deep Q-Learning, where it interacts with the market (based on historical stock prices) and learns optimal actions over time.

Model Architecture: The Deep Q-Network (DQN) is a neural network with input layers for stock price data, hidden layers for feature extraction, and output layers for action predictions (buy, sell, or hold).

Reinforcement Learning: The agent uses an epsilon-greedy policy where it explores actions with a certain probability (epsilon), and eventually exploits the learned actions.

Running the Code
To train the model, run the following script:

bash
Copy
python train_trading_agent.py
This will start the training process and save the model weights periodically (e.g., model_ep1.keras).

Testing the Model
After training, the model can be evaluated using a test set of stock data to see how well it performs on unseen data. To run the test:

bash
Copy
python test_trading_agent.py
This will output the trading actions (buy, sell, hold) at each time step, along with the total profit achieved by the model.

Visualizations
The modelâ€™s performance is visualized by plotting the stock prices along with the buy and sell signals, as well as the total profit achieved during the trading process.

Conclusion
The Deep Q-Learning-based agent successfully learns to trade and achieves profit on the test dataset. While further hyperparameter tuning and more extensive testing could improve performance, the model demonstrates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning for stock trading.
